## Understanding Diabetes

**Diabetes** is a long-term health condition that affects the way the body converts food into energy. It is marked by elevated blood glucose (sugar) levels, which occur when the body either doesn‚Äôt make enough insulin, cannot use insulin properly, or both.

### **Main Types of Diabetes**
1. **Type 1 Diabetes**  
   - An autoimmune disorder in which the immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  
   - Commonly diagnosed in children and young adults.  
   - Requires daily insulin administration to control blood sugar levels.  

2. **Type 2 Diabetes**  
   - Develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas fails to produce sufficient insulin.  
   - Frequently associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, inactivity, and unhealthy diet, though genetics also contribute.  
   - Managed through lifestyle modifications, oral medications, and sometimes insulin therapy.  

3. **Gestational Diabetes**  
   - Appears during pregnancy when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet increased needs.  
   - Typically resolves after delivery but raises the risk of type 2 diabetes later in life.  

### **Common Symptoms**
- Increased urination  
- Excessive thirst  
- Constant hunger  
- Tiredness or fatigue  
- Blurred vision  
- Wounds that heal slowly  
- Unexplained weight loss (more common in type 1 diabetes)  

### **Possible Complications if Left Untreated**
- Cardiovascular disease  
- Kidney damage  
- Vision problems (diabetic retinopathy)  
- Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy)  
- Higher susceptibility to infections  

### **Ways to Manage Diabetes**
- **Healthy Eating**: Following a balanced diet and limiting high-sugar foods.  
- **Physical Activity**: Exercising regularly to improve insulin sensitivity.  
- **Medication**: Using insulin or prescribed oral drugs when required.  
- **Monitoring**: Checking blood glucose levels on a regular basis.
